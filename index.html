		<h1>Sports</h1>
		<p>Many people use sports as a way to relieve stress they are experiencing at the moment. Many people have sports as one of their favourite hobbies. Some sports including Volleyball, rugby, basketball, etc have a lot of different rules that are hard to learn. One favourite sport of mine that I started playing at a young age was volleyball. It was the first sport I ever played in elementary school and I really enjoyed it. I have included a link which teaches you the most simple rules of volleyball adn about volleyball itself.</p>
