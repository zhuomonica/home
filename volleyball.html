		<h1>History</h1>
			<p>Volleyball, originally called “mintonette” was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan after basketball was invented four years before. Morgan was a graduate of the Springfield College of the YMCA who designed a combination of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball. The first volleyball net was only 6’6” high which was borrowed from tennis. In 1916 in the Philippines, the offensive style of setting and style was demonstrated. Over the following years, standard rules were being needed for tournament play which ended up with the USVBA (United States Volleyball Association) to be formed in 1928.</p>
